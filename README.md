My AI Usage

During the development of the Sweet Shop Management project, I leveraged AI tools to improve efficiency and streamline certain tasks.

AI Tool Used: ChatGPT

How I Used It:

Structured and planned frontend React components.

Suggested API route designs and backend logic organization.

Assisted in brainstorming validation strategies and database integration approaches.

Reflection:
AI helped me save time on repetitive boilerplate and gave guidance on structuring the project efficiently. All core logic, styling, and database integration were manually implemented, ensuring full understanding and control over the project. I ensured transparency by adding ChatGPT as a co-author in the relevant commits.
